    <h1>Reggie “0xDEADBEEF” Miller</h1>
<h2>Hacker</h2>
<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
Your name is Reggie Miller but everyone knows you by your hacker alias, 0xDEADBEEF, or BEEF for short.  Despite being only 18 years old, you’ve hacked the pentagon, the British secret service, and national banks in every country.  Unfortunately, you’re no longer technically a juvenile and the authorities are getting real tired of your shit.  As a result, you’re traveling to Beijing where you can lay low for a while and stay off the radar.  Hahahaha just kidding you’re going to light their shit up from behind international firewalls.
</p>
<p>
You’re basically the greatest hacker to ever grace this good earth and you know it.  The only thing you love more than defeating security is letting everyone know how good you are at defeating security.  And you never back down from a challenge.  Ever.  Come at me, bro.  I will DDOS you back to the epoch!
</p>

<h3>Roleplaying Tips</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You’re a really cool dude.  Dress appropriately.  Shades? Leather jacket? Baseball cap turned backwards?  You know it, dude.
</li>
<li>Your ego is out of control.  Brag about… everything.</li>
<li>The other noobs on this train are so basic they probably can’t even grok your l33t hacker lexicon.</li>
</ul>
