    <p>Nicely done!  You sell the Antigrav Coils to T.G., the Energon Crystals to Hyperion Engineering,
    the Gold Bullion to Fense Post, the Radioactive Sludge to Quik Fang, the Refined Hyperfuel to
    Lord Chroma, and the Titanium Screws to Craig Beavers for a total of 309 credits.  Not too
    shabby at all.</p>
    <p>Now, you couldn't help but notice that there's a lot of shady stuff happening on this train.
    Shady stuff means secrets, and secrets mean profit.  The Shadow Bazaar is an online hub where
    people can buy and sell goods and information.  Maybe the other passengers have valuable information
    that you could sell.  Additionally, if you can help them with their problems, they'll owe you
    a favor.  And you know that a favor is worth its weight in gold bullion.</p>
