    <p>What the heck?! Did you just... time travel?!  If there's one thing you're sure of, it's that time is money and
    you just got a bunch of extra time.  Better make the most of it.  It's pretty clear that no one
    on board is interested in your goods so you reach out to a few of your regular buyers.  You print
    off a list of potential buyers and a list of the goods in the crate.  Ask the conductor for your
    printout and get selling!</p>
