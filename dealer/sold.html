    <p>Nicely done!  You sell Key Lee the goods for 143 credits (plus applicable tax (
        plus service fee (plus finders fee (plus manditory tip (plus protection plan
        ))))) for a total of 309 credits.  Not too
    shabby at all.</p>
    <p>Now, you couldn't help but notice that there's a lot of shady stuff happening on this train.
    Shady stuff means secrets, and secrets mean profit.  The Shadow Bazaar is an online hub where
    people can buy and sell goods and information.  Maybe the other passengers have valuable information
    that you could sell.  Additionally, if you can help them with their problems, they'll owe you
    a favor.  And you know that a favor is worth its weight in titanium bars.</p>
