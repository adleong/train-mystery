<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
They call you Pockets, and you are a shrewd businessman.  Sure, your dealings can be questionably “ethical” or “legal”, but those are pretty abstract concepts and you’re just trying to make a (mostly) honest buck.  You buy, sell, and trade just about anything.  Hardware, software, drugs, secrets… just name it and you can get it; for a price, of course.  You alway turn a profit and you never fail to make a sale.
</p>
<p>
You’re currently in the process of moving some valuable goods from the UK to China in order to avoid a bunch of pesky “taxes”, “tariffs”, and “laws”.  Air traffic is too tightly regulated so you’ve taken your goods on the Transeurasian Hyperexpress train from London to Beijing.  Hopefully you’ll be able to find some buyers there that will make this trip worth your while.

<h3>Roleplaying Tips</h3>

<ul>
    <li>A shady guy like you probably dresses in a trenchcoat or dark colored jacket
</li>
<li>You’re motivated by money, but you know the value of being owed a favor.  You’re more than willing to help others and cash in the favor when you really need it.
