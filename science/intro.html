    <h1>Welcome Aboard</h1>



<p>Welcome aboard the Transeurasian Hyperexpress train from London to Beijing.  The train has entered mainland China and is nearing its final destination.  The journey has been quiet and uneventful and youâ€™ve mostly kept to yourself, tweaking the Sparc algorithm without any success.  But you've been holed up in your cabin for too long.  Time to walk around the train and stretch your legs. </p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check on Twenty-II, make sure they're doing okay</li>
    <li>Chat with the other passengers, maybe telling someone about your research will trigger an epiphany</li>
</ul>
