<p>What just happened?  You were dead.  And now you're not.  How is that possible?
For a moment before the conductor shot you, he seemed like he knew you.  Like he
had known you for a long time.  But that look is gone now.</p>
<p>
It seems that you have travelled through time to a few hours prior to your death.  You
had heard of theories that speculated that time travel could be possible but
you had never taken them seriously.  If you could discover what just happened,
you could publish the most incredible paper...
</p>
<p>
No, that's not important.  What's important is that someone wants you dead and
you only have a few hours to change the course of events.  The conductor now
doesn't seem like the same person who he was when he shot you; something fishy
is going on.  
</p>
<p>
If time travel is truly involved and if the theories that you've read hold any
water, then it's likely that information from the future is being transmitted 
into the present by a chrono-entangled radio wave.  If you can get access to the
train's antennas and tune them to 12.345kHz, you might be able to tap into the
signal from the future.
