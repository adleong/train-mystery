    <h1>Dr. Franklin Shine</h1>
<h2>The Scientist</h2>
<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
You are Dr. Franklin Shine, expert researcher in robotics and artificial intelligence.  All you life you have been chasing the goal of artificial sentience and now you’re so close you can almost taste it!  Your latest android, Twenty-II, is your most advanced yet.  You have been working on an algorithm called the Sparc which, in theory, can grant sentience to any sufficiently complex process.  Unfortunately, you haven’t been able to get the Sparc to work with Twenty-II yet, which is why you are taking him to Tsinghua University in Beijing to where your colleagues will help you work out the bugs.  To get there, the two of you will journey on the Transeurasian Hyperexpress train from London to Beijing.</p>

<p>
You’ve become quite fond of Twenty-II and consider him to be not just your creation, but also your friend.

<h3>Roleplaying Tips</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
As a scientist, you probably always wear a labcoat.  Potential other accessories include a clipboard, slide-rule, etc.</li>
<li>All topics must be approached with scientific rigor and all observations must be meticulously noted on your clipboard.</li>
<li>You tend to get over-excited about things and are prone to bouts of maniacal laughter and/or shouts of “Great Scott!”.</li>
</ul>
