<h1>Special Agents: Vodka and Martini</h1>
<h2>The Agents</h2>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
You are a pair special agents in the British secret service, codenames: Vodka and Martini. Your real names? That's classified, baby. You are one of the service’s most experienced teams and are virtuoso smoothtalkers. There’s never been a situation that you couldn’t bluff, debate, charm, or seduce your way out of.  You each carry a gun, of course, but to be honest you don't even know how to use them.
</p>
<p>
You’ve been tracking a terrorist organization called Daedalus. They call themselves “pro-human” but that really means that seek to destroy artificial intelligence and AI research at any cost. Intelligence reports suggest that Daedalus is smuggling weapons of some kind into China aboard the Transeurasian Hyperexpress train from London to Beijing. You’ve boarded the train in order to determine the nature of Daedalus’ plot and stop it before any innocent people get hurt. 
</p>
<h3>Roleplaying Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Secret agents are always well dressed (suit, badge, shades, etc.)</li>
<li>Saying that things are “classified” is a good way to sound smarter than you are</li>
<li>To show how classy you are, try to order your signature drink at every opportunity: a Manhattan on the rocks (obviously).</li>
</ul>
