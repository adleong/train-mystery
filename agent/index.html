<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
You are a pair special agents in the British secret service, codenames: Vodka and Martini. Your real names? That's classified, baby. You are one of the service’s most experienced teams and your skills
complement each other perfectly.  One of you is brains, the other is all brawn.  One good cop, one
bad.  One who plays it by the book and one reckless loose cannon who gets results.  You've been
working together a long time and you've seen a lot of shit.
</p>
<p>
You’ve been tracking a terrorist organization called Daedalus. They call themselves “pro-human” but that really means that seek to destroy artificial intelligence and AI research at any cost. Intelligence reports suggest that Daedalus is smuggling weapons of some kind into China aboard the Transeurasian Hyperexpress train from London to Beijing. You’ve boarded the train in order to determine the nature of Daedalus’ plot and stop it before any innocent people get hurt.
