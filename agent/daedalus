        Shots fired!  Code: cerulean!  Man down!  You would arrest the conductor on the spot except for one complicating factor:
        you seem to have travelled back in time to before the murder happened.  You can hardly arrest someone
        for a crime they haven't committed yet.  The best you can do is to try to figure out what's going
        on and stop the murder before it takes place.  Is the conductor in control of his own actions?
        Is this connected to the Daedalus plot?  Where are the smuggled weapons?
    </p>
    <p>
        Start by interrogating the conductor and any suspicious passengers to see what you can learn.
        Once you've done that, check in with <a href="/agent/hq">HQ</a>
