        You radio back to HQ to see if they have any additional information to
        help you crack this case.  "Are baby werewolves furry?", you discreetly
        ask into your earpiece.  "Only on tuesdays, or when wearing yellow shoes"
        comes the reply.  This exchange tells you that the secret service captured
        a Daedalus agent, that he's resisting intergation, and that he was carrying
        a strange map of London and an equally strange note.
    </p>
    <p>
        You request a copy of the map and note.  You have a hunch that they somehow
        encode the movements of Daedalus agents in London.  If you can figure out
        the exact route they take through the subways, it might be possible to 
        intercept and capture more Daedalus agents.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ask the conductor for the printout of the map and note and get to work
        figuring out what it all means.
