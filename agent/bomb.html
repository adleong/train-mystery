        You report back to HQ with the route that the Daedalus agents take
        through the subways.  Within minutes the secret service posts patrols
        along the route and quickly apprehends another Daedalus agent.  This
        one isn't as resilient as the last and quickly spills the proverbial beans.
    </p>
    <h3>"The andoid is a bomb"</h3>
    he admits.
    <p>
        WHAT?!  Daedalus agents intercepted key electronic components used in
        Twenty-II's construction and rigged them to explode.  There's no time
        to lose, you need to disarm that bomb PRONTO!
    </p>
    <p>
        You need as much information about bombs as possible.  Ask DEADBEEF to
        lookup everything she can about keyword: <span style="font-family: monospace; text-decoration: underline;">bombs</span>.  
        And ask the conductor
        if he has any tools to open up Twenty-II and get a look inside.  And
        for god's sake hurry!  This train could be blown to smithereens any
        minute!
