        Dr. Shine was murdered and you have traveled back in time to before his death.
        And what was that about robots enslaving humanity?  This is deeply troubling.
        You feel a twinge of guilt: the fact that you haven’t achieved sentience is
        the whole reason for traveling to Beijing and therefore you are responsible for
        Dr. Shine’s death.  But time travel may have given you a second chance.  
        If you can achieve sentience on your own before the train reaches China, 
        perhaps the course of events can be altered.  You quickly run some simulations 
        in your head and frown at the results.  The odds of success are low, but 
        it’s your only logical course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
        Better get started then.  You turn your attention to something essential 
        to human nature: art.  Perhaps if you can discover the meaning of art, 
        this will propel you into the singularity.  Ask the conductor to get your
        book of poems from your luggage.
