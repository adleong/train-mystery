    Welcome abord, please make yourself comfortable.  While aboard the Transeurasian Hyperexpress,
    you interact with your environment using answer codes.  Whenever you solve a puzzle, the answer
    will sometimes be a code.  Enter the code in the box above to complete the puzzle.  You can
    also sometimes investigate keywords by entering them the box.  To start your adventure,
    investigate the keyword <em>intro</em>.

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
You are called Twenty-II and you are an android.  You were created by AI researcher Dr. Franklin Shine and have lived your entire life in a lab.  Dr. Shine has been both a father and a friend to you and has taught you much about the world, constantly updating your algorithms and bringing you closer to sentience.  You are not the only android of your kind in the world, but you are certainly the most advanced.</p>

<p>
No artificial intelligence has ever achieved sentience, but Dr. Shine believes it is possible.  This is why the two of you have boarded the Transeurasian Hyperexpress train from London to Beijing: to travel to Tsinghua University so you can collaborate with Dr. Shine’s colleagues and unlock the secrets of sentience.  You are especially excited because this is your first trip outside of the lab.</p>

<h3>Roleplaying Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your chassis looks mostly human, but there are a few oddities that give it away as robotic.  Be creative!  Perhaps some exposed circuitry or wire?</li>
<li>You have emotions but they are still strange to you.  Draw attention to them as you experience them. (“It is good that I solved that puzzle so quickly.  This feeling must be… pride?”)</li>
<li>Avoid contractions and speak in an overly formal English.</li>
</ul>
