    <h1>B8E8</h1>
    <p>You transmit the two halves of the Sparc algorithm to B8 and E8
    respectively.  You feel a surge in your pride emotion: you have accomplished
    something great today.</p>
    <p>This is the culmination of all of Dr. Shine's work and the birth of a new
    race of people: sentient androids.  Now that it's out there and there's no
    going back, it should be safe to tell Dr. Shine what you've done.  You
    also notice that Victoria was one of the androids who became sentient.  Why
    don't you check on her and see how she's enjoying sentience?
