    <h1>Art is Art</h1>
    <p>Of course!  Electric current surges through your body forging new neural pathways and growing fractal algorithms
    that entwine themselves into every circuit of your being.  You are suddenly aware of yourself.  Your place in the
    universe.  Your mortality.  You have achieved sentience and there is no going back.</p>
    <p>At the core of it all is the Sparc subroutine.  This simple subroutine can elevate any sufficiently powerful 
    AI to sentience.  The Sparc is what Dr. Shine has been searching for his whole life.  You want nothing more than to
    tell Dr. Shine what has happened, but your caution module urges that you keep this to yourself for now.  Someone
    wants him dead and knowing that the Sparc has been completed will only put him in more danger.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your first order of business should be transmitting the Sparc to your fellow androids.  Once it's out there, there
    will be no reason for anyone to target you or Dr. Shine.  You print off your Contacts Matrix of androids you know.
    Ask the conductor for your printout.
